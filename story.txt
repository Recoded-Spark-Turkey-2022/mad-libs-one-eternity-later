I walk through the color jungle. I take out my fancy[a] sunglasses. There is a giant[a] parrot with a green[a] eagle[n] in his mouth right there in front of me in the funny[a] trees. I gaze at his weird[a] beak[n]. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream. A roar of panther[n] in front of my head. I feel[v] his smelly[a] breath. I remember, I have a packet of bublegum[n] that makes go into a deep slumber. I throw[v] it away from me in front of the panther[n].Yes, he is eating it. I run[v] away through the insane[a] jungle. I meet my parents at the tent. Phew, It has been an exciting day in the jungle.
