I walk through the color jungle. I take out my fancy[a] sunglasses.
There's a giant[a] parrot with a green[a] eagle[n] in his mouth right there in front of me in the funny[a] trees!
I gaze at his weird[a] beak[n]. A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther’s roar[v] in front of my head! I feel[v] his smelly[a] breath.
I remember I have a packet of bublegum[n] that makes go into a deep slumber!
I throw[v] it away from me in front of the panther[n].Yes he's eating it!
I run[v] away through the insane[a] jungle.
I meet my parents at the tent. Phew! It’s been an exciting day in the jungle.
